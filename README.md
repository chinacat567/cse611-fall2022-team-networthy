# NetWorthy - Staging Branch (Frontend Unstable + Backend Stable)

- All **Frontend** work stays here!
- Once a backend version (say be_v1) is ready, All FE Devs, please pull this branch and sync locally so as to have the latest BE Version.
- Once a full stack app version (say v1.0) is ready, kindly merge `Staging` into `Master` post Testing!
- Remember, don't forget to **test**!
