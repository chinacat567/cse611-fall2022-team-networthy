# NetWorthy - Dev Branch (Frontend Stable + Backend Unstable)

- All **Backend** work stays here!
- Once a backend version (say be_v1) is ready, please merge `Dev` into `Staging`.
- All BE Devs, please make sure to pull `master` into `dev` so as to be up-to-date with the latest FE changes.

**Happy Coding Folks!**
